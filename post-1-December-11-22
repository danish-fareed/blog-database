# This technology allows robots to sense touch, pressure, and texture with the same precision as a human hand.

Researchers at the University of Bristol have achieved a breakthrough in robotics technology by creating a robot hand with an accurate representation of human fingertips. The team, led by Nathan Lepora, professor of robotics and AI, achieved this sense of touch through 3D-printing a mesh of pin-like papillae, mimicking the bumps that form our fingerprints. This has opened up possibilities for robots with increased dexterity or more functional prosthetics for people who have lost limbs. According to Lepora, Our work helps uncover how the complex internal structure of human skin creates our human sense of touch.

The results of Lepora and his team's study revealed that their 3D-printed tactile fingertip could accurately produce signals similar to recordings taken from human tactile neurons. By comparing against data from a 1981 study, they discovered that the electrical signals generated by the 3D-printed fingertip closely resembled those recorded in the original experiment using real human fingers. This suggests that their fingertip can capture the pressure and shape of a contact with remarkable accuracy, effectively mimicking real human nerve signals.

The moment we saw our artificial nerve recordings from the 3D-printed fingertip look like real recordings from over 40 years ago, was nothing short of thrilling! Although the replication of a human fingertip and its nerves was very accurate, it could not still detect finer details due to its thicker 3D-printed skin. With further research and development, however, robots will likely be able to understand shapes better through improved dexterity with this new artificial skin. Professor Lepora and his team are looking to the future to make their artificial skin even more effective than that of human skin.

The University of Bristol research team, led by Nathan Lepora, has made a groundbreaking discovery in robotics technology by creating a robot hand with an accurate representation of human fingertips. Through 3D-printing a pin-like papillae mesh, the team could simulate the bumps found on human fingerprints and successfully recreate our sense of touch. This could have potential applications in creating robots with more dexterous abilities or prosthetic limbs for people who have lost them.

By comparing their results to data from a 1981 study on human tactile neurons, the team discovered that their 3D-printed fingertip could accurately generate electrical signals similar to those recorded from real human fingers. This finding implies that the fingertip can detect pressure and shape accurately, thus reproducing real human nerve signals.
