# It is impossible to know when the world will end, as it depends on what Humans do.

The most likely cause of Earth's final extinction is its engulfment in the Sun when it turns into a red giant. The Sun's outer envelope will expand throughout this process, and the Earth's orbit will rise but not enough to avoid impact with the growing star's lower atmosphere. Our world would be vaporised as a result. Other cosmic catastrophes, such as an asteroid or comet collision or a supernova explosion within a few light-years, have the potential to do enormous damage but lack the energy to completely destroy Earth.

Over the next five billion years, the likelihood of a catastrophic collision between Earth and one of the other terrestrial planets - Mercury, Venus, or Mars - is barely 1%.
Despite the fact that the universe is only 13 billion years old, Earth's orbit around the Sun has an estimated lifetime of 7.59 billion years. Following then, our planet would endure orbital decline and finally combine with the deceased Sun's remnant, albeit this might take up to 100 billion years.

The likelihood of a catastrophic collision between Earth and one of the other terrestrial planets - Mercury, Venus, or Mars - is only 1% during the next five billion years.

Earth's ultimate fate is most likely destruction as it is consumed by the Sun as it evolves into a red giant. The outer layers of the star will expand, extending Earth's orbit but not enough to avoid impact with the growing fireball's lower atmosphere. Our world would be vaporised as a result of this. Other cosmic phenomena, such as asteroid and comet collisions or supernova explosions within a few light-years of Earth, have the potential to do significant damage but lack the energy necessary to kill the planet.

Over the next 5 billion years, there is only a 1% chance that Earth will experience a severe collision with Mercury, Venus, or Mars. However, because the universe is only 13 billion years old, our planet's orbit around the Sun has an expected lifespan of 7.59 billion years, followed by orbital decay until it ultimately merges with what remains of the dead Sun - a process that might take up to 100 billion years.
