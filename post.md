# It is impossible to know when the world will end, as it depends on what Humans do.

The total annihilation of Earth is most likely to be caused by its engulfment in the Sun as it transforms into a red giant. During this process, the Sun's outer envelope will expand, and the Earth's orbit will increase but not enough to escape interaction with the lower atmosphere of the expanding star. This would result in the vaporization of our planet. Although other cosmic events, such as an asteroid or comet impact, or a supernova explosion within a few light-years, have the potential to cause significant damage, they are unlikely to have enough energy to destroy Earth entirely. The possibility of a catastrophic collision between Earth and one of the other terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, or Mars - is only 1% over the next five billion years.
Even though the universe is only 13 billion years old, Earth has a predicted lifespan of 7.59 billion years in its orbit around the Sun. After that, our planet would experience orbital decay and eventually merge with the dead Sun's remnant, though it may take up to 100 billion years for that to occur.

Earth's ultimate fate is most likely to be its annihilation as it gets engulfed by the Sun when it transitions into a red giant. The outer layers of the star will expand, increasing the orbit of Earth but not enough to escape contact with the lower atmosphere of the expanding fireball. This would lead to the vaporization of our planet. Although other cosmic events such as asteroid and comet impacts or supernova explosions within a few light-years have the potential to cause serious damage, they lack the energy required to destroy Earth. The possibility of an extreme collision between Earth and one of the other terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, or Mars) is just 1% over the next 5 billion years. However, since the universe is only 13 billion years old, our planet has an estimated lifespan of 7.59 billion years in its orbit around the Sun, followed by orbital decay until it eventually merges with what remains from the dead Sun – although this could take up to 100 billion years.
