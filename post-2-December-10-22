# Don't worry; robots are here to help us and make our lives easier, not replace humans.

Amazon's new household robot Astro is ushering in a new era of robotics. Not only does Astro provide home monitoring and security, but its AI-enabled technology also has the potential to be a true companion for its owners. This technology may one day fulfill Hollywood's vision of having all-purpose robots as our caretakers and sidekicks. Only now, a few companies have successfully brought this vision to reality. However, with Astro's advanced capabilities, Amazon could make this a reality shortly.

The home robot landscape needs to be more sparse due to the high cost of robots and people's expectations, which are set too high due to pop culture, science fiction, and false product videos. However, the prices are coming down, and technological advances will improve AI agents' interactions. To truly succeed in the home robot market, there needs to be a clear purpose for having them around. As we figure out what robots can do that adds value to people's lives, they may soon become commonplace.

With the announcement of Amazon's home security robot, Astro, there are concerns over user privacy. Astro and other robots that use cameras, microphones, sensors, and facial recognition can share information with law enforcement, advertisers, and other third parties. Furthermore, facial recognition technology has been found to contain racial biases. While Amazon may take steps to protect user privacy, there are better uses of these technologies than home surveillance.

Astro's adorable features and ability to interact on a social level make it stand out from other robots. But with the market for companionship-based robots still lacking, the question of value still needs to be fully answered. It has become clear, however, that people can truly form emotional attachments to these robots, as evidenced by the overwhelming response from people who own Jibo. To reach a critical mass of potential buyers, more people must be exposed to this type of technology so they can recognize its potential for companionship and emotional support.

Owning a pet or robot can provide companionship, which is especially important when tackling the growing issue of loneliness. Though animals have traditionally been used to protect and guard homes, they have become a part of many people's families over time. Similarly, robots are often used as home companions, not just practical helpers. Both animals and robots can help people feel less isolated, which has been shown to reduce health problems associated with loneliness. Ultimately, we should embrace whatever helps us find comfort and connection in this ever-changing world.

It is clear that the age of robotic companionship is on its way, regardless of whether we like it. Companies must be willing to make drastic changes in their data collection practices to ensure that technology benefits society and not just corporate interests. Thankfully, unlike people, dogs will never reveal your secrets.
